qgpkg
========

Introduction
------------
qgpkg uses the OGC `GeoPackage <http://geopackage.org/>`_ specification to store
QGIS mapping information in a GeoPackage database file.

The OGC geopackage format was designed with the goal of **being interoperable across a range of environments, in particular mobile devices operating in offline and near offline scenarios**.

This plugin introduces two approaches for storing mapping projects, encoded in two different geopackage extensions:
the `QGIS extension <https://github.com/pka/qgpkg/blob/master/qgis_geopackage_extension.md>`_ and the `OWS context extension <https://github.com/pka/qgpkg/blob/master/ows_geopackage_extension.md>`_.

The goal of the ``qgis geopackage extension`` is to enable users to share their QGIS projects, including style and resources.
This extension stores a QGIS project file in one of the extension tables, which works for the described use case, but does not allow interoperability with other GIS software.

The ``ows geopackage extension`` was designed With the specific goal of enabling interoperability with other GIS sofwtare, being completely based on OGC standards.
The idea is to store styling using OGC:SLD, and the project context using OGC:OWS_Context, so that other software can encode/decode this information.

In both extensions, data, resources and style are packed along with project information (e.g.: layer order or visibility, bounding box), enabling a self-contained, portable mapping project.

QGIS plugin
-----------
The QGIS plugin adds three buttons to the QGIS GUI. One for saving the current
project in a GeoPackage file, another one for loading a QGIS project from a
GeoPackage file, and a third one to display an ``about`` dialog.

Support is given for loading multiple layers and styles from the geopackage. In the `examples <./examples>`_ folder you may find examples of
geopackages using the `qgis <./examples/small_world.gpkg>`_ and `ows <./examples/multiple_layers.gpkg>`_ extensions. The screenshot bellow refers to ``multiple_layers.gpkg``:

Although the user can read from either extension, using a detection mechanism, currently the writing operation is only supported for the ``qgis extension``.
If you are interested in writing geopackages using the ``ows extension``, please have a look at `ArCGIS GeoCat Bridge <https://www.geocat.net/bridge/>`_.

qgpkg library and cli
---------------------
In addition, gpkg is implemented as a Python library with a command line interface.

Commands::

  usage: qgpkg.py [-h] {info,write,read} ...

  Store QGIS map information in GeoPackages

  optional arguments:
    -h, --help         show this help message and exit

  commands:
    valid commands

    {info,write,read}
      info             GeoPackage content information
      write            Save QGIS project in GeoPackage
      read             Read QGIS project from GeoPackage

Please note that the cli supports **only** for the ``qgis extension``.

History
-------
This plugin was first implemented by CÃ©dric Christen and Pirmin Kalberer (Sourcepole) using the ``qgis_extension`` approach.
Later it was forked by Joana Simoes and Paul van Genuchten (GeoCat), who added support to the ``ows_extension``.
The fork was merged into the master branch, to create this version: a plugin which enables users to read projects using either geopackage extension.
Support to writing in both extensions, is also envisioned for the near future.

Compatibility
-------------
This plugin requires ``QGIS`` >= 2.18, compiled using ``Qt4`` and ``PyQt4``.

As the plugin reads geopackages generated by ArcGIS GeoCat Bridge, which uses a recent gdal version,
in order to be able to open those files you **need** to compile QGIS with ``gdal`` >=2.0.

Unfortunately, in the ubuntu/linux public repositories, there are no QGIS packages compiled against gdal2.
However if you are on OS X, you can use the package compiled by `King Chaos <http://www.kyngchaos.com/software/qgis>`_.

Development
-----------
